analysis:
  intent:
    summary: "Improve discoverability of Printf standard library by adding @sprintf examples to the docstring for `string(n::Integer; base, pad)`. Motivated by a Discourse question where a user found `string(::Int; pad)` but wanted similar functionality for floats, which Printf provides."

  secondary_effects:
    - effect: "Users reading the docstring for `string(::Integer; pad)` will now discover Printf as an alternative for more flexible formatting, including floating-point numbers."
      mechanism: |
        User calls `?string` or reads documentation for `string(::Integer; base, pad)`
          -> Sees "See also ... and the Printf standard library"
          -> Sees @sprintf examples with %04i (zero-pad) and %4i (space-pad)
          -> Can extrapolate to Printf for floats: @sprintf("%08.3f", 3.14159)
