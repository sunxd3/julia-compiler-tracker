# Compiler Change: Julia 1.12 -> 1.13

Goal: collect every PR and commit that affects the Julia compiler between the 1.12 and 1.13 releases, then summarize and categorize them for analysis.

Planned steps (high-level):
- identify the release tag/branch boundaries
- enumerate PRs and commits touching compiler-related paths
- export results into structured data for review
