  "body": "This PR is the result of three thoughts:\r\n1. `versions.jl` is a weird place for the banner function to live, when we have `REPL`\r\n2. It's annoying when the banner either (nearly) takes up the entire terminal frame, or actually reflows and breaks (visually)\r\n3. The banner could be a little fancier, visually\r\n\r\nThe result of these three thoughts is a set of six banner sizes, selected based on `displaysize` to ensure that this never happens:\r\n\r\n<image src=\"https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/assets/20903656/d57e7207-d7c3-4818-b32f-645cb3b4ad0f\" height=\"300\">\r\n\r\n**The variants below are outdated**, see this comment for more up-to-date screenshots: https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/pull/51811#issuecomment-1938261062\r\n\r\n> **The six variants** (outdated)\r\n> \r\n> <image src=\"https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/assets/20903656/7186c8ce-5d69-41da-a38b-5fec4a62718c\" height=\"400\">\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThere are two issues I'm currently facing that I'd appreciate help with:\r\n1. Precompilation annoyances: it seems I need to change the `eval` in `StyledStrings/src/stylemacro.jl` to `Core.eval(__module__` during precompile, even if the code is pure. Furthermore, I find myself needing to change the clause on line 669 to `state.interpolated[] || Base.generating_output()`. This seems a little dodgy, and so I'd appreciate thoughts.\r\n2. **[solved]** ~~For some reason, with this PR the banner doesn't appear on starting `julia`. Yet, as seen by the screenshot above invoking `REPL.banner` does work. I have confirmed that `REPL.banner` is indeed called, and so find myself at a loss here.~~",
