  "body": "Run CommonMark spec tests against all supported Markdown flavors. This way we may notice regressions in any flavor, not just the default one.\r\n\r\nOf course the different flavors have different success rates (e.g. some CommonMark spec tests fail with the `julia` flavor due to the en/em extension which converse `--` and `---` into en- resp. em-dashes).\r\n\r\nAlso (ab)use the spec tests to automatically derived cheap \"weak\" round trip tests. That is, for some plain text input, we parse it, then convert this into plain text, and parse it again. Then we compared the two parse outputs, which of course should agree.\r\n\r\nThis is weaker than taking the initial plain input, parsing it, converting that to plain text, and comparing the two plain texts. But that kind of test is problematic because Markdown usually has multiple ways to encode things (e.g. three different list marker bullets, two different ways to mark text as italics, etc.). But the weaker version already catches a lot of issues.",
