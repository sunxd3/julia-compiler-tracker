  "body": "If a method we precompile instantiates a closure struct, and there is a single compileable signature for the closure method, we can compile the closure method with few downsides.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n```\r\nf(x::T) where {T <: Number} = y::T -> x+y\r\nprecompile(f, (Int,))\r\n\r\nf(1)(2)\r\n```\r\n\r\nBefore, the closure method would not get precompiled, resulting in `--trace-compile` output:\r\n`precompile(Tuple{Foo.var\"#f##0#f##1\"{Int64, Int64}, Int64})`\r\n\r\nThis idea was motivated by trying to make the REPL precompile script more \"static\".  Creating a task with `@task` or `@async` expands into a no-argument lambda, which won't get precompiled with the containing method.",
