  "body": "The tuple specialization for indexing with UnitRanges is highly optimized, type stable, and constant foldable for statically known values like these.\r\n\r\nSeems like a very good thing to just lean on that.  It's how I would've written this in the first place had that optimized method existed when I wrote it.  It's much more readable and \u2014\u00a0I imagine \u2014\u00a0it should be quite a bit friendlier to the compiler.    The only time you should see a performance difference here is when you have a SubArray with 11 or more indices **and** one of those indices is 3-dimensional or more.",
