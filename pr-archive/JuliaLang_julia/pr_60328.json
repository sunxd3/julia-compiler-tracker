([#56845])\n-  - New `nth` function to access the `n`-th element of a generic iterable. ([#56580])\n-  - New `@__FUNCTION__` macro to refer to the innermost enclosing function. ([#58940])\n-  - The character U+1F8B2 \ud83e\udcb2 (RIGHTWARDS ARROW WITH LOWER HOOK), newly added by Unicode 16,\n-    is now a valid operator with arrow precedence, accessible as `\\hookunderrightarrow` at the REPL.\n-    ([JuliaLang/JuliaSyntax.jl#525], [#57143])\n-  - Support for Unicode 17 ([#59534]).\n+* New `@__FUNCTION__` macro to refer to the innermost enclosing function ([#58940]).\n+* The character U+1F8B2 \ud83e\udcb2 (RIGHTWARDS ARROW WITH LOWER HOOK), newly added by Unicode 16,\n+  is now a valid operator with arrow precedence, accessible as `\\hookunderrightarrow` at the REPL\n+  ([JuliaLang/JuliaSyntax.jl#525], [#57143]).\n+* Support for Unicode 17 ([#59534]).\n \n Language changes\n ----------------\n-* `mod(x::AbstractFloat, -Inf)` now returns `x` (as long as `x` is finite), this aligns with C standard and is considered a bug fix ([#47102])\n \n-* The `hash` algorithm and its values have changed for certain types, most notably AbstractString. Any `hash` specializations for equal types to those that changed, such as some third-party string packages, may need to be deleted. ([#57509], [#59691])\n-\n-* The `hash(::AbstractString)` function is now a zero-copy / zero-cost function, based upon providing a correct implementation of the `codeunit` and `iterate` functions. Third-party string packages should migrate to the new algorithm by deleting their existing overrides of the `hash` function. ([#59691])\n-\n-* Indexless `getindex` and `setindex!` (i.e. `A[]`) on `ReinterpretArray` now correctly throw a `BoundsError` when there is more than one element. ([#58814])\n-\n-Compiler/Runtime improvements\n------------------------------\n+* The `hash` algorithm and its values have changed for certain types, most notably `AbstractString`.

It is thrown away after startup (and after startup.jl), before any user code is executed ([#59234])\n-* New `--trace-eval` command-line option to show expressions being evaluated during top-level evaluation. Supports `--trace-eval=loc` or just `--trace-eval` (show location only), `--trace-eval=full` (show full expressions), and `--trace-eval=no` (disable tracing). Also adds `Base.TRACE_EVAL` global control that takes priority over the command-line option and can be set to `:no`, `:loc`, `:full`, or `nothing` (to use command-line setting). ([#57137])\n-* Julia now automatically enables verbose debugging options (`--trace-eval` and `JULIA_TEST_VERBOSE`) when CI debugging has been triggered. i.e. via the \"debug logging\" UI toggle is enabled on github actions re-runs. Other platforms are supported too ([#59551])\n+* The `--code-coverage=all` option now automatically throws away sysimage caches so that code coverage can be accurately measured on methods within the sysimage.

It has extra padding to avoid false sharing ([#55944]).\n-* New types are defined to handle the pattern of code that must run once per process, called\n-  a `OncePerProcess{T}` type, which allows defining a function that should be run exactly once\n-  the first time it is called, and then always return the same result value of type `T`\n-  every subsequent time afterwards. There are also `OncePerThread{T}` and `OncePerTask{T}` types for\n-  similar usage with threads or tasks. ([#TBD])\n-\n-Build system changes\n---------------------\n+* A new `PaddedSpinLock <: AbstractSpinLock` is defined.

When set to `true`,\n-  it enables verbose testset entry/exit messages with timing information and sets the default `verbose=true`\n-  for `DefaultTestSet` to show detailed hierarchical test summaries ([#59295]).\n-* Exporting function `fieldindex` to get the index of a struct's field ([#58119]).\n-* `Base.donotdelete` is now public. It prevents deadcode elimination of its arguments ([#55774]).\n+* The `fieldindex` function (to get the index of a struct's field) is now exported ([#58119]).\n+* `Base.donotdelete` is now public.

([#59372])\n+  now the abstract base type for both `ScopedValue` and `LazyScopedValue` ([#59372]).\n * New `Base.active_manifest()` function to return the path of the active manifest, like `Base.active_project()`.\n-  Also can return the manifest that would be used for a given project file ([#57937])\n+  Also can return the manifest that would be used for a given project file ([#57937]).\n \n Standard library changes\n ------------------------\n \n-#### JuliaSyntaxHighlighting\n-\n-#### LinearAlgebra\n-\n-#### Profile\n-\n-#### Random\n-\n+* `mod(x::AbstractFloat, -Inf)` now returns `x` (as long as `x` is finite).

See the REPL docs for more info about customization.\n * The REPL now supports automatic insertion of closing brackets, parentheses, and quotes. See the REPL docs for more info about customization.\n * History searching has been rewritten to use a new interactive modal dialogue, using a fzf-like style.\n * The display of `AbstractChar`s in the main REPL mode now includes LaTeX input information like what is shown in help mode ([#58181]).\n * Display of repeated frames and cycles in stack traces has been improved by bracketing them in the trace and treating them consistently ([#55841]).\n+* The superscript character U+107A5 \ud801\udfa5 (MODIFIER LETTER SMALL Q), which was already supported in the language, can now be accessed at the REPL with `\\^q` ([#59544]).\n \n #### Test\n \n+* `Test` now supports the `JULIA_TEST_VERBOSE` environment variable. When set to `true`,\n+  it enables verbose testset entry/exit messages with timing information and sets the default `verbose=true`\n+  for `DefaultTestSet` to show detailed hierarchical test summaries ([#59295]).\n * Test failures when using the `@test` macro now show evaluated arguments for all function calls ([#57825], [#57839]).\n * Transparent test sets (`@testset let`) now show context when tests error ([#58727]).\n * `@test_throws` now supports a three-argument form `@test_throws ExceptionType pattern expr` to test both exception type and message pattern in one call ([#59117]).\n@@ -124,12 +103,52 @@ Standard library changes\n External dependencies\n ---------------------\n \n-Tooling Improvements\n---------------------\n+* 7-Zip updated from p7zip v17.06 to upstream 7-Zip v25.01.
