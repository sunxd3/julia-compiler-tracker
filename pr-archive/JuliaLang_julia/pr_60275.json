  "body": "This is really a Pkg bug, where I forgot to implement the clamping when generating the manifest (and will submit a PR), but since we clamp and override when loading from a Project.toml, it seems reasonable to do the same for Manifest.toml. We never want to use a syntax version less than 1.13, so cut off that path as well, without assuming that Pkg.jl gets it right (too much manual editing of Manifest files happening with AI assistants).\r\n\r\nFixes #60273\r\nWritten by Claude.",
