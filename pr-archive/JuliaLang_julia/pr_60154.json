  "body": "Progress towards issue #56922 by @LilithHafner. Turns out I didn't find many uses of `Array{T, 1}` or `Array{T, 2}` in `doc` or `base` that were \"clearly\" in need of being updated to `Vector` or `Matrix`. \r\n\r\nThere are a bunch that can't be changed because they occur before `Vector` or `Matrix` are even defined.\r\n\r\nThere are a couple borderline cases, and I may have overlooked some, but most I looked at felt like \"I could change it to Vector or Matrix but I think there is a didactical point in using `Array` here. E.g. in the definition of `struct BitVector <: AbstractArray{Bool, 1}; end` I think the context makes it desirable to leave it at that instead of changing it to `Vector` -- but I admit this is subjective.\r\n\r\nThere was more in `test`, though that's perhaps less important.\r\n\r\nAll in all I think we could close #56922",
