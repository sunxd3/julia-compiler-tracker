  "body": "I should have noticed this when reviewing #60567 . The justification / comments added by Claude here were very misleading. They explain that these values are different but not why.\r\n\r\nThat said, the confusion here is a bit understandable. The `is_capt` naming is a probably overloaded: \"captured anywhere\" is very different than \"introduced in an outer function\". Might be worth revisiting in a future re-factor.\r\n",
