  "body": "Since at least v0.3, `MersenneTwister` has stored the user-provided seed. More recently, this allowed `show` to print a round-trippable representation of the RNG. However, storing an arbitrary deep-copied user seed is not ideal, and the initialization logic has become more complicated than necessary.\r\n\r\nIn particular, `MersenneTwister()` currently performs three steps:\r\n\r\n1. `seed = rand(RandomDevice(), UInt128)`           # generate a seed\r\n2. `initstate = rand(SeedHasher(seed), UInt32, 8)`  # expand it\r\n3. initialize dSFMT with `initstate`\r\n\r\nThis commit merges the first two steps. The new initialization is:\r\n\r\n1. `initstate = rand(RandomDevice(), NTuple{2, UInt128})`\r\n2. convert `initstate` to the dSFMT format and initialize the state\r\n\r\nWe now store only `initstate` for use in `show`, preserving round-trippability. For user-provided seeds, `initstate` is derived from the seed via `SeedHasher`.\r\n\r\nA small bonus is that `MersenneTwister()` is no longer restricted to \"only\" 2^128 distinct initializations.\r\n\r\nThe cosmetic drawback is that the printed representation is less pretty: `MersenneTwister(1)` now shows as\r\n```\r\nMersenneTwister(0xc53bc12f4c3f0b4efff0241072ddab67, 0x50a4aa153d208dd856d451780b2dd4ba)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is based off #60185 to avoid merge conflicts.",
