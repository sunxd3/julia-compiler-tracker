  "body": "Somewhat of a companion to https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/pull/60248.\r\n\r\nFor a small application that has just started up `fork()` is not a huge concern, but it's quite heavy-handed for Julia- as-a-library scenarios where resident memory may already be large. Many soft-embedded targets also do not support fork() well, so it is good for our compatibility to adjust this.\r\n\r\nRather than relying on the linker to do all of the heavy lifting, this changes our `libstdcxx` probe sequence to directly parse the `ld.so.cache` and `libstdc++.so.6` files. As long as we can expect `/etc/ld.so.cache` to be the same path on all Linux systems, this seems to be a reliable way to locate system libraries.\r\n",
