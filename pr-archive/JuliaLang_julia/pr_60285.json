  "body": "@stevengj [remarked](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/pull/22089#issuecomment-305479765) in his original PR introducing this file that the Unicode superscripts and subscripts are annoyingly scattered all over the place \u2014 as evidenced by the fact that there are still a few good ones missing.  Specifically, I was trying to use superscript alpha (`\\^alpha<tab>`), which fails.\r\n\r\nThere are *many* Unicode entries with \"subscript\" or \"superscript\" in the name \u2014 not all of which need to be included in the list, but I think it would be fair to include all characters that are available in Julia with tab completion starting with either `\\_` or `\\^`.  The current `src/flisp/julia_opsuffs.h` file is just 6 short of that goal.  Three of the missing are inarguably mistaken omissions: superscript alpha \u1d45, epsilon \u1d4b, and (Latin) phi \u1db2.  We also have subscript < \u02f1 and > \u02f2, which also seem like natural fits on a list that also include subscript = \u208c, ( \u208d, and ) \u208e.  The last candidate is subscript schwa \u2094, which is borderline since it's not really a math-y character; on the other hand, making that the only intentional omission is the kind of thing that would really bug me if I were the poor jerk who wanted it.  But I won't die on that hill.",
