  "body": "Do not allow serial compile fallbacks, since this causes performance\r\nand output degredation when serial precompile fails. The precompilepkg\r\ndriver already ensured DAG ordering, so this work is not necessary or\r\nuseful to repeat. A bit of code cleanup and asking for Claude to\r\ndescribe the argument list as well, plus a test to start to cover any\r\nof this file's code functionality in CI unit tests.\r\n\r\nThis then lets us fix a lot of the error printing issues too, since we\r\nknow each package will only get one chance to load, not once for each\r\nappearance in the dependency tree. Now it tries to be slightly more\r\ncareful about when and where output should be printed: progress goes to\r\nlogio (either io or devnull) while output goes to io always and errors\r\nget returned without duplicating both the error text and output\r\nmessages of them also.\r\n    \r\nThe main logic here is that we need to print all output if any\r\nrequested packages failed, but we print only output from successful\r\npackages if all requested packages succeeded. If a package was\r\nsuccessful, then its output is required to be printed since it will not\r\nbe regenerated in the future (we don't reprint precompile output on\r\nloading since that might be obnoxious for us to implement). If a\r\nrequired package is successful however, none of the failures mattered\r\nand they will be regenerated in the future when they are required, so\r\nthose should be completely filtered out.",
