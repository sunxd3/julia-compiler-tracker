  "body": "This goes in the opposite direction to https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/pull/60454.\r\n\r\nOn x86-64 Windows, we're unfortunately pretty reliant on this timer to avoid (otherwise unavoidable) deadlocks between `RtlLookupFunctionEntry` and many other internal functions in the Windows runtime (incl. `RtlAllocateHeap` and `LdrLoadDll`).\r\n\r\nFor unknown reasons, `RegisterWaitForSingleObject` seems to be quite bad about dropping the callback on the floor in contended situations (we deadlock but the timer callback is simply never called). This alternative API appears to be better-behaved.\r\n\r\nThis does not solve the deadlock identified by @xal-0 in https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/pull/60454#issuecomment-3687877148 (or several others)\r\n\r\nNonetheless it appears to be a significant improvement on my machine.",
