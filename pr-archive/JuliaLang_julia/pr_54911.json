  "body": "- **Replace JL_HAVE_UCONTEXT by JL_TASK_SWITCH_WINDOWS**\n- **Untangle OpenBSD checks in julia_threads.h**\n- **Rename JL_HAVE_UNW_CONTEXT -> JL_TASK_SWITCH_LIBUNWIND**\n- **Rename JL_HAVE_ASM -> JL_TASK_SWITCH_ASM**\n\nWhenever I try to understand the task switch code, I have to figure out\nagain when which of the various `JL_HAVE_*` constants are set, how they\ninteract, etc. -- and indeed recall that `JL_HAVE_*` controls the task\nswitching code in the first place.\n\nSo it seems sensible to me to rename these to indicate they control task\nswitching. This is in particular true for `JL_HAVE_UCONTEXT` which\nwas/is exclusively used on on Windows, despite the reference to\n`ucontext`, a POSIX feature (albeit one removed from the standard in\nPOSIX.1-2008).\n\nOf course it is still conceivable that in the future someone wants to\nport Julia to a new platform and for some reason libunwind switching is\nnot workable, but the `ucontext` one is -- in that case it wouldn't be\ntoo hard to add back a `JL_TASK_SWITCH_UCONTEXT`. But IMHO such a\nhypothetical future is a good reason to confuse people trying to\nunderstand the code today.\n\n",
