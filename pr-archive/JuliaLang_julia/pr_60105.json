  "body": "Ports our RTDyLD memory manager to JITLink in order to avoid memory use regressions after switching to JITLink everywhere (#60031).  This is a direct port: finalization must happen all at once, because it invalidates all allocation `wr_ptr`s.  I decided it wasn't worth it to associate `OnFinalizedFunction` callbacks with each block, since they are large enough to make it extremely likely that all in-flight allocations land in the same block; everything must be relocated before finalization can happen.\r\n\r\nI plan to add support for DualMapAllocator on ARM64 macOS, as well as an alternative for executable memory later.  For now, we fall back to the old MapperJITLinkMemoryManager.",
