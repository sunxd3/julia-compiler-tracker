Otherwise,\n-`X` is an array with the same number of dimensions as the sum of the dimensionalities of all the\n-indices.\n+We can also use the special keywords `begin` and `end` to specify the first and the last index along a specific dimension.\n \n-If all indices `I_k` are vectors, for example, then the shape of `X` would be `(length(I_1), length(I_2), ..., length(I_n))`,\n-with location `i_1, i_2, ..., i_n` of `X` containing the value `A[I_1[i_1], I_2[i_2], ..., I_n[i_n]]`.\n+```jldoctest\n+julia> A = reshape(1:35, 5, 7);\n \n-Example:\n+julia> A[begin+1, end-2]\n+22\n+```\n+\n+We got the $1 + 1 = 2^{nd}$ row, and within that, the $7 - 1 = 6^{th}$ column. At first glance, `begin` might seem  a bit redundant, but if somebody has a crazy implementation of `AbstractArray` where the indexing begins with $0$, or $42$, or something else, `begin` starts to make a lot more sense.\n+\n+Indexing into a multidimensional array is similar, we choose the block from each dimension that will lead us to the element we want to select. To understand this better, lets first create a $3 \\times 4 \\times 2 \\times 3$ four-dimensional array.\n \n ```jldoctest\n-julia> A = reshape(collect(1:16), (2, 2, 2, 2))\n-2\u00d72\u00d72\u00d72 Array{Int64, 4}:\n+julia> B = reshape(1:3*4*2*3, 3, 4, 2, 3)\n+3\u00d74\u00d72\u00d73 reshape(::UnitRange{Int64}, 3, 4, 2, 3) with eltype Int64:\n [:, :, 1, 1] =\n- 1  3\n- 2  4\n+ 1  4  7  10\n+ 2  5  8  11\n+ 3  6  9  12\n \n [:, :, 2, 1] =\n- 5  7\n- 6  8\n+ 13  16  19  22\n+ 14  17  20  23\n+ 15  18  21  24\n \n [:, :, 1, 2] =\n-  9  11\n- 10  12\n+ 25  28  31  34\n+ 26  29  32  35\n+ 27  30  33  36\n \n [:, :, 2, 2] =\n- 13  15\n- 14  16\n+ 37  40  43  46\n+ 38  41  44  47\n+ 39  42  45  48\n+\n+[:, :, 1, 3] =\n+ 49  52  55  58\n+ 50  53  56  59\n+ 51  54  57  60\n+\n+[:, :, 2, 3] =\n+ 61  64  67  70\n+ 62  65  68  71\n+ 63  66  69  72\n+```\n \n-julia> A[1, 2, 1, 1] # all scalar indices\n-3\n+One way to visualize this array is to think of it as having a bunch of two-dimensional ($3 \\times 4$) arrays.

In the example above, reading from the right, I first want to choose the $3^{rd}$ outer block. Put another way, I want to choose the $3^{rd}$ element along the fourth dimension. Within that, I want to choose the $2^{nd}$ inner block. Again, put another way, I want to choose the $2^{nd}$ element along the third dimension. This gives me the $3 \\times 4$ array I want. Once I have that, I choose the row and column as before -- choose the $2^{nd}$ row and $4^{th}$ column. You can continue to read this from the right, i.e., select the $4^{th}$ element along the second dimension, and then finally select the $2^{nd}$ element along the first dimension.\n \n-If `I_1` is changed to a two-dimensional matrix, then `X` becomes an `n+1`-dimensional array of\n-shape `(size(I_1, 1), size(I_1, 2), length(I_2), ..., length(I_n))`. The matrix adds a dimension.\n+We need to provide an index for each dimension, for `A`, we need to provide 2 numbers in the index, for `B` we need to provide 4 numbers in the index, and so on. Otherwise we'll get an error. Except, if you only provide a single number, in which case we'll get an element back. The reason for this is discussed in the [Linear Indexing](@ref) section. For now, remember that we need to provide an index for each dimension.\n \n-Example:\n+### Range Indices\n \n-```jldoctest\n-julia> A = reshape(collect(1:16), (2, 2, 2, 2));\n+Instead of choosing specific elements along different dimensions, I can even choose a range of elements in that dimension.

For example, if `J` is an array of indices, then the result of `A[2, J, 3]` is an\n-array with size `size(J)`. Its `j`th element is populated by `A[2, J[j], 3]`.\n+In this example, I am choosing the $2^{nd}$ row as before, but now I want all the elements in the $2^{nd}$ through $4^{th}$ columns. Below is a slightly more involved example where I want all the odd-numbered rows, and from those rows, I want all the elements in the $2^{nd}$ through $4^{th}$ columns.\n \n-As a special part of this syntax, the `end` keyword may be used to represent the last index of\n-each dimension within the indexing brackets, as determined by the size of the innermost array\n-being indexed. Indexing syntax without the `end` keyword is equivalent to a call to [`getindex`](@ref):\n+```jldoctest\n+julia> A = reshape(1:35, 5, 7);\n \n-```\n-X = getindex(A, I_1, I_2, ..., I_n)\n+julia> A[begin:2:end, 2:4]\n+3\u00d73 Matrix{Int64}:\n+  6  11  16\n+  8  13  18\n+ 10  15  20\n ```\n \n-Example:\n+Range indices and some of the other indexing styles that we'll discuss below give us back another array. This is a **copy** of the original array. Modifying the returned array is not going to modify the original array in any way.\n \n-```jldoctest\n-julia> x = reshape(1:16, 4, 4)\n-4\u00d74 reshape(::UnitRange{Int64}, 4, 4) with eltype Int64:\n- 1  5   9  13\n- 2  6  10  14\n- 3  7  11  15\n- 4  8  12  16\n+### Array Indices\n \n-julia> x[2:3, 2:end-1]\n-2\u00d72 Matrix{Int64}:\n- 6  10\n- 7  11\n+What if the elements we want cannot be specified in a range?

The dimensions of the resulting array are based on the dimensions of the input indices. Ignoring all the scalar indices, the resulting array's shape is the length of the vectorized indices. For example if `J` is a vector of indices, then `B[2, J, 1, 2]` is an array with `length(J)`, and its `j`th element is `B[1, J[j], 1, 2]`. More generally speaking, if $y = X[I_1, I_2, \\cdots, I_n]$ and all $I_k$ indices are vectors, then $y$ will be an $n$-dimensional array its shape will be $(length(I_1), length(I_2), \\cdots, length(I_n))$, with $y[i_1, i_2, \\cdots, i_n] = X[\\;I_1[i_1], I_2[i_2], \\cdots, I_n[i_n]\\;]$.\n \n-```\n-A[I_1, I_2, ..., I_n] .= X\n-```\n+But why stop at vectorized indices? Why not have matrices as indices?\n \n-Just as in [Indexing](@ref man-array-indexing), the `end` keyword may be used\n-to represent the last index of each dimension within the indexing brackets, as\n-determined by the size of the array being assigned into.

However, this does not seem to hold for examples in this section. `A[idx]` has a single item in the index for a 2-dimensional array. `B[2, 4, mask]` are just 3 items, whereas `B` has 4 dimensions. So what gives? Remember, the boolean mask is expanded to the coordinates of all its `true` cells. `A[idx]` expands to `A[1, 1], A[2, 2], etc.`. Similarly `B[2, 4, mask]` expands to  `B[2, 4, 2, 3]` and `B[2, 4, 1, 2]`. We are stil providing an index for each dimension, its just...masked  ;-) For this reason the dimensions of the `mask` should match the dimensions that I am specifying. Remember, `B` is $3 \\times 4 \\times 2 \\times 3$, i.e., its last two dimensions are $2 \\times\\ 3$, and because `mask` is trying to specify the coordinates of elements in these two dimensions, it must also be a $2 \\times 3$ array. Of course this idea can be extended to any number of dimensions. If I want to specify the last three dimensions, then I need to use a $4 \\times 2 \\times 3$ mask, and so on.\n \n-julia> A[1:2:5]\n-3-element Vector{Int64}:\n- 1\n- 5\n- 9\n+It seems pretty tedious to create boolean masks by hand, and indeed this is not the way boolean masks are used. We usually use some sort of a predicate function that will filter elements from our main array and use that predicate to create our mask. Lets say we have a two-dimensional matrix of integers. Further, lets say we want to select all the even elements from this matrix. We can use the [`iseven()`](@ref) function for this. However, this function only accepts a `Number`,  not an **array** of numbers.
