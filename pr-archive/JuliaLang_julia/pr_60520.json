As such, the two PRs interact: the test added in this PR here will need to be adjusted for PR #60519, so these two PRs should *not* be merged simultaneously, otherwise CI will start failing. Rather, if one is merged, then the other needs to be adapted accordingly. I'll be happy to take care of that.",
