  "body": "Python now ships their default REPL with syntax highlighting (https://realpython.com/python-repl-autocompletion-highlighting/#syntax-highlighting), and I find it unacceptable that the default Python REPL should be (in some cases) better than ours ( :wink: ).\r\n\r\nIt has long been possible to get syntax highlighting from the external OhMyREPL package, but now, since we have StyledStrings + JuliaSyntaxHighlighting as stdlibs, it seems kind of a waste not to use those for this. OhMyREPL also has to touch a lot of internals and there are some awkward corner cases with it so proper first-class support would avoid this.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the highlighting it also adds a little marker showing what parenthesis you are inside (analogous to https://kristofferc.github.io/OhMyREPL.jl/latest/features/bracket_highlighting/). The existing region marking is also implemented in the \"pass framework\" here.\r\n\r\nBy default, the JuliaSyntaxHighlighting is quite conservative:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"298\" height=\"226\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/64dbb301-17e1-4447-92ee-52906fb1fcc3\" />\r\n\r\nBut with a custom `faces.toml` file (as shown in the docs) you can fancy it up to your liking:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"294\" height=\"228\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/183539be-c4da-4d5d-92d4-ab46fae812b5\" />\r\n\r\nWIP Because of tests.\r\n\r\nWritten in a beautiful symbiosis between man and machine.",
