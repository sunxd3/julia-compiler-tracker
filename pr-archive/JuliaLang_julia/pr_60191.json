  "body": "We currently use keyword arguments as arbitrary key-value pairs in a number of\r\n     places, which I've realized isn't really how they're intended to be used.\r\n      This change fixes this and reduces the JuliaLowering package image size by\r\n     about 20% on my machine from `26.910 MiB -> 21.701 MiB`, or when compiled\r\n     into sysbase.dylib, `+55MB -> +45MB`.  Unfortunately no change to\r\n     precompile time as I had hoped, but I figured this is worth doing anyway.\r\n     Lowering performance looks unchanged.\r\n\r\nI've just used `Vector{Pair}` or explicit `setattr` calls, but let me know if\r\n     there's a better way of doing this.\r\n\r\nAlso let me know if you have a reason for the difference in size when compiled\r\n     into Base---I don't think I'm accidentally producing two copies, but you\r\n     never know.",
