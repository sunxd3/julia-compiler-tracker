  "body": "Changes to the compiler in 1.12, while very welcome, caused work for some packages that interface with the compiler. I'm aware of https://github.com/chalk-lab/Mooncake.jl/pull/714 and https://github.com/TuringLang/Libtask.jl/pull/196, there are probably others. This is of course understandable and unavoidable when packages interface with internals that aren't public.\r\n\r\nHowever, as discussed on Slack a few times, it would be very useful for package maintainers if there was even a rough list of changes, and advice on how to adapt to them. To kickstart this, I started a draft with changes I encountered in 1.12. It is very incomplete (reflecting my very superficial understanding of the compiler), and I would be grateful and happy if those who know this stuff better would be up for completing it, merging it, and adding to it as more things happen in 1.13.",
