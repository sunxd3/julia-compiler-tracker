  "body": "Another unfortunate interaction between PRs. A proper fix for this regression will come, but for now let's make the tests pass again so that nobody else has to suffer from this mistake.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nTo explain: locally I work on an integration branches (were all my Markdown work comes together), and then split out work for individual commits. I tested both the integration branch and the individual PRs, and all was fine. But then in master suddenly the failure. Why did my tests on my integration branch not catch this? Because there's another in-flight change on there, which *hides* the issue (but does not fix it), namely, I've switched the spec tests to not use the \"Julia flavor\" but rather the \"common flavor\". I'm sorry for any inconvenience I may have caused. On the upside, I am now aware of this \"hides the issue\" problem and will think about ways to deal with it. Most likely I'll just let it test both with the Julia and the Common(Mark) flavor, so that regressions in both are caught.",
