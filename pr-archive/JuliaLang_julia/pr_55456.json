  "body": "It's nice to visually differentiate different levels of nesting (and actually print more than one). Closes #18615.\r\n\r\nWith this markdown list as an example:\r\n```md\r\n- some list\r\n  - with nesting\r\n  - and items\r\n    - at many levels\r\n  - some text\r\n    - meaningless words\r\n      - even more words\r\n- yet another item\r\n  - am I really still going?\r\n- this is the end\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt's currently printed like this:\r\n```\r\n    \u2022  some list\r\n       \u2022 with nesting\r\n       \u2022 and items\r\n       \u2022 at many levels\r\n       \u2022 some text\r\n       \u2022 meaningless words\r\n       \u2022 even more words\r\n\r\n    \u2022  yet another item\r\n       \u2022 am I really still going?\r\n\r\n    \u2022  this is the end\r\n```\r\n\r\nwith this PR, it's printed like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    \u2022  some list\r\n       \u27a4  with nesting\r\n       \u27a4  and items\r\n          \u2013  at many levels\r\n       \u27a4  some text\r\n          \u2013  meaningless words\r\n             \u27a4  even more words\r\n    \u2022  yet another item\r\n       \u27a4  am I really still going?\r\n    \u2022  this is the end\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR:\r\n- fixes the 1-limited nesting bug\r\n- fixes a bonus bug with non-loose nested lists getting extra newlines, and,\r\n- introduces depth-dependent bullets\r\n\r\nOn my end, this seems to e working well, but it would be good if people could try this out and check I haven't accidentally introduced any edge-cases.",
