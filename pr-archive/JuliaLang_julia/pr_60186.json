This was also reverted on `master` (#59984) but after `release-1.13` had branched, so the same change is needed here; without this, the build cannot complete because precompiling REPL deadlocks. Thanks to @xal-0 and @IanButterworth for their help in identifying the cause.\r\n\r\n@KristofferC, given that the current v1.13.0-alpha1 tag is effectively unbuildable, I suggest we delete it and retag once this is merged.",
