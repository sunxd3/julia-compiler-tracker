  "body": "This is cleanup separated from another change where I needed\r\nto call these by hand without `@ast` to help me.\r\n\r\nThe only significant diff is in syntax_graph.jl, where I've addressed a TODO I\r\nleft earlier.  Instead of changing `makenode`/`makeleaf`'s behaviour based on\r\nwhether `proto` is a SyntaxTree or Kind (there isn't any situation where we\r\ndon't know this), split \"new node with kind and provenance\" functions\r\n`newnode`/`newleaf` and \"copy attributes and transform existing node\" functions\r\n`mknode`/`mkleaf`.  I will accept some function name bikeshedding if anyone has\r\nsuggestions.\r\n\r\nOther tweaks:\r\n- Remove the attribute-vector parameter since most of the arbitrary attribute\r\n  stuff happens in `@ast`, where we just produce `setattr!` calls\r\n- Tighten up some signatures, mostly for documentation purposes, and because\r\n  these things are less up-in-the-air than when JL was a new project\r\n",
