  "body": "This implements a native version of automatic re-export, similar to the macro from Reexport.jl. Doing this natively in the binding system has two key advantages:\r\n\r\n1. It properly participates in binding resolution and world ages. If a new binding is Revise'd into a re-exported module, this will now propagate.\r\n\r\n2. The re-exported bindings are allocated lazily, improving performance.\r\n\r\nAn accessor for this functionality is provided as `@Base.Experimental.reexport`. However, the only supported argument to this macro is single `using` statement (unlike the Reexport.jl version, which has more syntax). It is my expectation that Reexport.jl will be updated to make use of the underlying functionality here directly, the base version of the macro is mostly for testing.\r\n\r\nThere are a few design warts here - in particular, we inherit the module name exporting behavior\r\n(https://github.com/JuliaLang/Reexport.jl/issues/39).\r\n\r\nHowever, I think that would be best addressed by not exporting the module name itself from the modules but rather introducing the module name as an additional binding on `using` statements.\r\n\r\nHowever, this would be potentially breaking (even if the effect is unlikely to be seen in practice), so I'm not proposing it here. The Reexport.jl version of the macro can do whatever it needs to, including creating an explicit non-exported binding to suppress the automatic re-export for this if desired.\r\n\r\nPartially written by Claude Code.",
