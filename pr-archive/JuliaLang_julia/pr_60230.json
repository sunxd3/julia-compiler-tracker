  "body": "Apple ARM CPUs treat the `ic ivau` as a memory read, which causes a confusing crash in DualMapAllocator if we try using it on a `wr_addr` that has been mprotected to `Prot::NO`, since we are still holding the allocator lock.\r\n\r\nFor Apple aarch64 systems with SIP disabled, this will result in some memory savings, since DualMapAllocator will now work there.  Like before, other JITLink platforms, namely Linux aarch64 and RISC-V, will benefit too.\r\n\r\nThis re-lands #60105, after it was reverted in #60196.  Thanks @giordano!",
