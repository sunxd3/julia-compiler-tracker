  "body": "This is purely a code movement PR.  @c42f has noted that `SyntaxTree` may eventually replace `SyntaxNode` and should be part of JuliaSyntax.  Doing this code movement before https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/pull/59870 would have been a mess, though, since the API to `SyntaxTree` is still under development.  \r\n\r\nEasiest to review commit-by-commit.  Summary of changes:\r\n- Move `syntax_graph.jl` and associated tests to JuliaSyntax, including parts of `ast.jl` that are necessary to construct trees (needed for parsing to `SyntaxTree`) and excluding anything that needs to know about lowering `Kind`s or `Bindings`\r\n- Update docstrings and file names to clarify the difference between the trees. Mention that `SyntaxTree` is unstable/JuliaLowering-only for now.",
