Any `hash` specializations for equal types to those that changed, such as some third-party string packages, may need to be deleted. ([#57509], [#59691])\n \n-* The `hash(::AbstractString)` function is now a zero-copy / zero-cost function, based upon providing a correct implementation of the `codeunit` and `iterate` functions. Third-party string packages should migrate to the new algorithm by deleting their existing overrides of the `hash` function. ([#59691])\n-\n-* Indexless `getindex` and `setindex!` (i.e. `A[]`) on `ReinterpretArray` now correctly throw a `BoundsError` when there is more than one element.

It is thrown away after startup (and after startup.jl), before any user code is executed ([#59234])\n-* New `--trace-eval` command-line option to show expressions being evaluated during top-level evaluation. Supports `--trace-eval=loc` or just `--trace-eval` (show location only), `--trace-eval=full` (show full expressions), and `--trace-eval=no` (disable tracing). Also adds `Base.TRACE_EVAL` global control that takes priority over the command-line option and can be set to `:no`, `:loc`, `:full`, or `nothing` (to use command-line setting). ([#57137])\n-* Julia now automatically enables verbose debugging options (`--trace-eval` and `JULIA_TEST_VERBOSE`) when CI debugging has been triggered. i.e. via the \"debug logging\" UI toggle is enabled on github actions re-runs.
