  "body": "And similarly for `randcycle` and `shuffle`.\r\n\r\nWe had a custom version of range generation for `randperm`, which was based on the ideas of our previous default range sampler `SamplerRangeFast` (generate `k`-bits integers using masking and reject out-of-range ones) and took advantage of the fact that `randperm` needs to generate `rand(1:i)` for `i = 2:n`.\r\n\r\nBut our current range sampler (\"Nearly Division Less\") is usually better than this hack, and makes these functions more readable. Typically, for array lengths `< 2^20`, the new version is faster, but gets slightly slower beyond 2^22.\r\n\r\nHere are some speedups:\r\n![randperm-ndl-speedup](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/assets/8462914/b999ba43-e588-49f4-91a2-a4b23e79716d)\r\n\r\nThe slow down for big arrays seems fine to me, but I will see if I can find an easy workaround.\r\n\r\nFix #57771.",
