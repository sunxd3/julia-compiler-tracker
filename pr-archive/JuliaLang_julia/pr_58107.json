  "body": "When I originally learned about multithreading and locks (and ended up rewriting [https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/multi-threading/#man-using-locks](Using locks to avoid data-races)), I was puzzled to find that the association of a lock and a value was the mental task of the programmer, and not the programmatic task of the program. I made that explicit in that section of the manual, writing the following:\r\n> Note that the link between a lock and a variable is made by the programmer, and not the program.\r\n\r\nI was therefore very happy to see Base.Lockable introduced in Julia 1.11. What was missing, was any mention of it in the relevant section of the manual.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a subsection under locks (So a forth level of headings, not sure if that is fine), showcasing and reccomending the use of Base.Lockable. I have made heavy use of comments in the example, which breaks with the general style, but adds valuable interpretation along the way. I am very open restructuring that part in particular.",
