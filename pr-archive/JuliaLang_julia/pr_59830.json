      "patch": "@@ -111,10 +111,6 @@ Standard library changes\n * Introspection utilities such as `@code_typed`, `@which` and `@edit` now accept type annotations as substitutes for values, recognizing forms such as `f(1, ::Float64, 3)` or even `sum(::Vector{T}; init = ::T) where {T<:Real}`. Type-annotated variables as in `f(val::Int; kw::Float64)` are not evaluated if the type annotation provides the necessary information, making this syntax compatible with signatures found in stacktraces ([#57909], [#58222]).\n * Code introspection macros such as `@code_lowered` and `@code_typed` now have a much better support for broadcasting expressions, including broadcasting assignments of the form `x .+= f(y)` ([#58349]).\n \n-#### Dates\n-\n-* `isoweekdate, isoyear, weeksinyear` are now implemented and available for week based calendars, following [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_week_date](ISO week date).
