    summary: |
      Clarifies documentation about module import syntax by moving an existing sentence
      about "keeping the namespace clean" and adding `using ModuleName: ModuleName` as
      an equivalent alternative to `import ModuleName`. This change was originally part
      of PR #53428 but was split out to reduce review confusion.

            # and added "using ModuleName: ModuleName" as alternate syntax

    notes: |
      This PR has ZERO impact on downstream packages. It is purely a documentation
      clarification that helps users understand that `import ModuleName` and
      `using ModuleName: ModuleName` are equivalent syntaxes for keeping namespaces clean.
      No code paths, APIs, or behaviors are affected.

  conclusion: |
    Independent analysis confirms this PR is strictly documentation. The changes
    restructure an existing sentence about "keeping the namespace clean" and add
    mention of the equivalent `using ModuleName: ModuleName` syntax. There are no
    code changes, no compiler impact, and no secondary effects to consider. The
    original analysis is accurate and complete.
