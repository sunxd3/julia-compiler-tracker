    summary: |
      Documentation-only PR that fixes two issues:
      1. A typo in doc/src/devdocs/types.md - "by" was changed to "be" in the sentence
         about method sorting with identical signatures ("will instead by compared"
         was corrected to "will instead be compared")
      2. A broken cross-reference link in doc/src/manual/methods.md - the "World age"
         link was using anchor `man-worldage` which does not exist. The actual page-level
         anchor is `man-world-age` (note the extra hyphen). The PR changed the link to
         reference `World-age-in-general` which is the anchor for the "World age in general"
         section heading in worldage.md.

            Additionally, if 2 methods are defined with identical signatures, per type-equal, then they
            will instead by compared by order of addition, such that the later method is more specific
            than the earlier one.

          note: |
            The page-level anchor is `man-world-age` (line 1), but the PR uses the section anchor
            `World-age-in-general` which corresponds to the "## World age in general" heading.

            ## World age in general

            The "world age counter" is a monotonically increasing counter that is incremented for every
            change to the global method table or the global binding table (e.g. through method definition,
            type definition, `import`/`using` declaration, creation of (typed) globals or definition of constants).

    rationale:
      - "Documentation-only change with no code modifications"
      - "Fixes a typo and a broken link - no semantic changes to compiler behavior"
      - "No impact on any compiler pipeline stage"
      - "Verified: The original link anchor `man-worldage` does not exist (confirmed via grep)"
      - "Verified: The new link target `World-age-in-general` correctly resolves to worldage.md section heading"

    findings:
      - "Verified typo fix by reading types.md lines 528-530"
      - "Verified broken link: grep for `@id man-worldage` returns 0 results - anchor did not exist"
      - "Verified correct anchor: grep for `@id man-world-age` returns worldage.md:1 (page-level anchor)"
      - "Note: Original broken link used `man-worldage` (missing hyphen), while actual anchor is `man-world-age`"
      - "The PR chose to link to section anchor `World-age-in-general` rather than page anchor `man-world-age` - both would work"

      - "Added before/after snippets for typo fix evidence"
      - "Removed ellipses from worldage.md snippet (quality requirement)"
      - "Added clarification about WHY the original link was broken (missing hyphen)"
      - "Added verification notes to risk rationale"
