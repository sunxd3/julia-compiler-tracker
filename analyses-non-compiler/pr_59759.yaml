analysis:
  intent:
    summary: "Switch the Julia 1.12 release branch CI to use the release-specific Buildkite configuration branch instead of the main branch. This ensures CI jobs on the 1.12 release use version-appropriate CI settings."
    issue_links: []
  direct_changes:
    - summary: "Changed .buildkite-external-version from 'main' to 'release-julia-1.12' to point CI configuration to the 1.12-specific branch in the julia-buildkite repository."

  risk:
    level: low
    rationale:
      - "This is a CI-only change with no compiler, runtime, or semantic impact."
      - "Affects only which Buildkite configuration branch is used for the Julia 1.12 release CI jobs."
      - "No downstream package impact whatsoever."
      - "VERIFIED: grep search found no references to .buildkite-external-version in Julia source code."
  open_questions: []
  recommendations:
    - "This PR has no impact on downstream packages or compiler behavior. No action required for package maintainers."
reviewer_notes:
  independent_verification: |
    Confirmed via grep that .buildkite-external-version is not referenced by any Julia source code.
    The file is consumed only by external Buildkite CI infrastructure at https://github.com/JuliaCI/julia-buildkite.
    The .buildkite directory is in .gitignore (lines 44-45), confirming CI configuration is managed externally.
  analysis_quality: "The original analysis is accurate and complete. Minor enhancements added to show diff and verification evidence."

  summary: "This is a CI infrastructure change only. It modifies the Buildkite branch reference for Julia 1.12 release CI jobs. There are no compiler changes, no semantic changes, and no impact on any downstream packages or tooling."
