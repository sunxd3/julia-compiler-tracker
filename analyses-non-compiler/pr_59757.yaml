      Release management PR that bumps the VERSION file from 1.12.0-rc3 to 1.12.0,
      marking the official release of Julia 1.12.0 from release candidate status.

  secondary_effects:
    - effect: "Base.VERSION.prerelease changes from ('rc3',) to ()"
      mechanism: |
        The VERSION file is parsed by base/version.jl to create Base.VERSION.
        For "1.12.0-rc3": VERSION.prerelease = ("rc3",)
        For "1.12.0": VERSION.prerelease = ()
        This affects version comparison: v"1.12.0" > v"1.12.0-rc3"
      downstream_surfaces:

      likelihood: "high"
      impact: "low"
      compiler_relevant: false
      notes: |
        This affects only package loading logic at lines 2413-2417 of base/loading.jl
        which checks prerelease compatibility for manifest regeneration warnings.
        No compiler behavior is affected.

      VERIFIED: No VERSION-dependent conditionals exist in Compiler directory.

    compiler_prerelease_checks: |
      VERIFIED: No prerelease checks in Compiler directory.
      Search performed: rg "prerelease" Compiler/
      Result: No matches found (only static v"1.12.0-DEV.1581" requirement message in Compiler.jl)

  downstream_impact:
    summary: |
      No downstream impact on compiler internals, type inference, or optimization.
      This is a pure release management change affecting only the reported Julia version.
      Independent verification confirmed Compiler/ directory has no VERSION dependencies.

  risk:
    level: "low"
    rationale:
      - "Changes only the VERSION file, no code changes"
      - "Standard release management procedure"
      - "No compiler, runtime, or library code affected"

  recommendations:
    - |
      This PR marks the official release of Julia 1.12.0. Downstream packages should
      update any version compatibility bounds if they specifically target 1.12.x releases.

classification:
  category: "release_management"
  compiler_relevant: false
  notes: |
    This PR is flagged as a compiler PR in the dataset but contains no compiler changes.
    It is purely a version bump marking the transition from RC3 to official 1.12.0 release.
    No analysis of compiler internals, type inference, optimization, or code generation
    is applicable to this PR.

review:
  independent_analysis_performed: true
  reviewer_notes: |
    Independent verification confirmed the original analysis is accurate.
    Additional findings:
    1. Checked out merge commit b907bd0600f7041cce39a028cd63a1e154b42d62
    2. Verified single-file change: only VERSION file modified (1.12.0-rc3 -> 1.12.0)
    3. Searched Compiler/ directory for VERSION dependencies - none found
    4. Searched for prerelease conditionals in compiler - none found
    5. Identified non-compiler secondary effect: Base.VERSION.prerelease becomes empty tuple
    6. The loading.jl prerelease checks (lines 2413-2417) are package loading, not compilation
